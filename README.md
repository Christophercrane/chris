### Welcome  
**A collection of code and enablement to support your AI journey.**

Sometimes a good old fasion deck really is the best way to communicate.   
  
  
<details>
 
  <summary markdown="span">Polyglot Bot: Write in one language, delivery to many.</summary>
This deck outlines the benefits and architecture of a translation solution that enables translation of a Watson Assistant skill into any of the many available languages offered via Watson Language Translator.

  <summary markdown="span">Feature Codes and IBM Cloud Administration: What they mean and why they are important</summary>
This deck outlines how to apply your feature codes, the duties of a cloud administrator and why the role is important to define and assign.

  <summary markdown="span">Watson Assistant Logs: What are they and how to get them</summary>
This deck outlines the contents of Watson Assistant Logs, the method for obtaining them and where to find supporting documentation.

  <summary markdown="span">Sizing complex AI solutions with multiple services and environments</summary>
This deck outlines a methodology for sizing complex AI use cases involving multiple services, environments and use cases. There is a lengthy preamble (storytime) before I discuss the methodology. This is mainly for context and entertainment value. Skip to page five to get straight to the methodology. 

-[Sizing complex AI use cases: A step by step walkthough for sizing AI solutions with multiple services and environments](https://github.com/Christophercrane/Decks/blob/master/Project%20Watson%20Usage%20v3.pdf)  

This methodology references a spreadsheet which can be found here. Download to use:

  <summary markdown="span">IBM Federation</summary>
This deck outlines where to find a complete Federation overview as well as lining out the process for unfederating individual users. Unfederating individual users is important if the organization still wishes to allow some users to have their own lite plan accounts for sandboxing. Federation happens at the URL level so a company could federate xyz.com but not xyz.org or xyz.es for example.

  <summary markdown="span">Hierarchical Classifier: Scale expertise by systematizing known hierarchies</summary>  
This project includes an engine that leverages Watson Assistant, Cloud Functions and Visual Recognition to identify the Genus, Species and Varietal of plants. Plants are used as a muse but this engine could be used against any image subject matter once trained.

-Trigger a set of LCPN classifiers   
-Enforce hierarchy structures
-Transparently surface classification results and values  
-Allows for human assisted classification  
-Stores results in a System Of Record  
-Can be used by a  non technical person.
